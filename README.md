Code Chunks marked in .pynb file:

1. The code snippet provided is intended to perform image feature extraction using the VGG16 model. However, it's incomplete, and the part responsible for image feature extraction is missing. This process typically involves loading images, preprocessing them, passing them through the VGG16 model, and extracting features from a specific layer. Once the image features are extracted, they can be further processed or used for various tasks such as image classification, object detection, or similarity comparison.

   The code snippet includes a step to upload a CSV file using the files.upload() function from the Google Colab library. This function allows users to upload files from their local system directly to a Google Colab notebook environment.

2. This code reads data from a CSV file named "A2\_Data.csv" and processes it to fetch and save images. The CSV file contains information about images, including their URLs. The script downloads these images from the URLs and saves them to a folder named "extracted\_images" in the local file system. Each image is saved with a unique filename based on its index in the CSV file.
2. This code extracts features from images using the pre-trained ResNet50 model. It takes a folder path as input, reads images from that folder, processes them, and extracts features using ResNet50. These features are then normalized and stored in a dictionary where the keys are file names and values are the corresponding normalized feature vectors. Finally, the normalized features are saved to a file named "image\_features\_resnet.pkl" using Pickle for later use.
2. This code preprocesses text data from a CSV file ("A2\_Data.csv") and calculates TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scores for each term in the text documents. TF-IDF is a numerical statistic that reflects the importance of a term in a document relative to a collection of documents. The preprocessing steps include lowercasing, removing special characters, tokenizing, removing stopwords, stemming, and lemmatization. After preprocessing, TF (Term Frequency) and DF (Document Frequency) are calculated for each term. TF-IDF scores are then computed using the formula:

   TF-IDF = TF Ã— IDF

   where TF is the term frequency in the document. IDF is the inverse document frequency, calculated as the logarithm of the total number of documents divided by the document frequency of the term. The calculate\_tf\_idf function returns a dictionary containing TF-IDF scores for each document. The normalize\_tf\_idf function normalizes the TF-IDF scores to a range of 0 to 1. Finally, the TF-IDF scores for the first document are printed. If any document has no terms after preprocessing (as in document 828), it's assigned an empty TF-IDF dictionary.

5. This code downloads an image from a given URL and saves it to a folder named "input\_images" with the filename "input\_image1.jpg". If the folder doesn't exist, it creates one. Here's a breakdown:

   **Function Definition:** Defines a function download\_image to download and save an image from a URL.

   **Folder Creation**: Checks if the "input\_images" folder exists. If not, it creates the folder.

   **Image Download:** Downloads the image from the provided URL using the download\_image function and saves it with the filename "input\_image1.jpg" in the "input\_images" folder.

6. This code snippet extracts the top 3 file names with the highest cosine similarity from a set of image features compared to the input image features. It then extracts data from rows in a DataFrame based on the row numbers associated with these filenames. Here's a summary of what the code does: Extract Image Features: The function extract\_image\_features extracts features from an input image using a pre-trained ResNet50 model. These features are then normalized. Compute **Cosine Similarity**: The cosine\_similarity function calculates the cosine similarity between two vectors. Find **Top 3 Similarities:** The top\_3\_similarity function computes the cosine similarity between the input image and all images in the dataset. It then selects the top 3 images with the highest similarity.

   **Extract Data:** The extract\_data function retrieves data from the DataFrame for the specified row numbers. **Example Usage**: The code demonstrates how to use these functions to extract data for specific rows based on the top similar images.

7. This code attempts to find the cosine similarity between the input text and the text reviews associated with the top 3 images that have the highest cosine similarity with the input image. Here's a brief explanation of what the code does:

   **Preprocess Text:** The preprocess\_text function preprocesses the input text by converting it to lowercase, removing special characters, tokenizing it, removing stopwords, and performing stemming and lemmatization. **Compute Cosine Similarity:** The cosine\_similarity\_text function computes the cosine similarity between two text vectors. It handles cases where one vector is shorter than the other. Find Index for Input Text: The get\_index function finds the index of the input text in the TF-IDF scores data. It compares the TF-IDF scores of each review with the TF-IDF scores of the input text and returns the index of the matching review.

   **Calculate Similarity with Image Text:** For each review in the extracted data, the code computes the cosine similarity between the TF-IDF vector of the review and the TF-IDF vector of the input text. Output Results: The code prints the details of the top 3 reviews along with their cosine similarity scores with the input text and the average similarity between the text and image.

8. This script calculates the cosine similarity between the input text and the text reviews associated with the top 3 images having the highest cosine similarity with the input text. Here's a summary of what it does:

   **Preprocess Text:** Preprocesses the input text by converting it to lowercase, removing special characters, tokenizing it, removing stopwords, stemming, and lemmatizing.

   **Compute Cosine Similarity (Text):** Defines a function to compute cosine similarity between two text vectors. Handles cases where one vector is shorter than the other.

   **Find Index for Input Text:** Find the index of the input text in the TF-IDF scores data by comparing the TF-IDF scores of each review with the TF-IDF scores of the input text.

   **Calculate Similarity with Image Text:** Computes the cosine similarity between the TF-IDF vector of each review text and the TF-IDF vector of the input text.

   **Find Top 3 Similarities (Text)**: Identifies the top 3 reviews with the highest cosine similarity scores to the input text.

   **Extract Data:** Extracts the image filenames and review texts associated with the top 3 reviews. Compute Cosine Similarity (Image): Calculates the average cosine similarity between the input image and each of the top 3 images.

   **Output Results:** Prints the image filenames, review texts, cosine similarity scores between the input text and reviews, cosine similarity scores between the input image and images, and the average similarity between the text and image for each of the top 3 reviews. This script is designed to provide insights into the similarity between the input text and reviews as well as the similarity between the input image and the images associated with the top 3 reviews.
